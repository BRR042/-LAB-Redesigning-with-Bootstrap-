                <h1>My Web Development and Web Design History</h1>
                <p>My experience in web design or web development is that I took CTI-110 at Cleveland Community College in the fall semester of 2023, and I learned skills to make cool websites. We learned ways to use CSS and HTML. Other than that course, I have had no experience in web design or web development.</p>
                <h2>What I hope to learn from Web-140</h2>
                <p>I hope to learn to use my new web development and web design skills to change the world because these are skills not many people possess or want to possess. So I hope to improve as a man and learn from this course.</p>
                <h3>What I hope to do with my new Web Development and Web Design Skills.</h3>
                <p>I hope that no matter what happens with my web development and web design skills, I can hopefully use my skills to spread the gospel of what God has done for me and all of mankind to make the world a better place and so we can be his for eternity. This is just my real answer for what I hope to accomplish by having these skills.</p>
